Perplexed by this, you decide you should probably write a piece of Python code that stores these entries in a dictionary called \"candidates\", and which allows the user to input a number to find out the corresponding \"candidate\" surname. If the user inputs a candidate number that doesn't exist, the system should warn them of this and allow them to input again. The system should also keep asking the user to input candidate numbers until the user types -1, at which point the program says \"Goodbye\" and terminates."

Try the function out by calling it with two lists (try playing with various number of common elements to test it), and after the function is called, print a message that confirms how many elements are common to both lists. You should add exception handling such that if anything other than two lists are passed to the function, a message appears saying that something went wrong, and the message about the number of common elements is never displayed. Test the error handling by trying to pass something other than two lists (e.g. one list, three lists, an integer etc)."

The user should be asked to input numbers to test until they input 0, at which point the program terminates. You should include exception handling around the input to catch invalid entries. A Pandas DataFrame should store a record of the run number (starting at 1, incrementing by 1 for each new number tested), each number tested and whether it was prime or not, and should be displayed to the user once they exit. The index for the dataframe should be set as the run number.\n",
